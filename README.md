# rit-angle

This repository contains a few solutions to the first and second rounds of the [Ritangle 2022](https://integralmaths.org/ritangle/2022) competition along with a full solution to the final question. [finalq_jy](/final_q/finalq_jy) contains Jude Young's work and [finalq_pt](/final_q/finalq_pt) contains Peter Thyan's work on the last question.

There is also a [writeup](/final_q/finalq_jy/writeup.md) of the best solution (found with [finalq_jy.py](/final_q/finalq_jy/finalq_jy.py)) which provides an explanation of how we solved the problem.
